# Snazzie Website

* * *

## What is this?

Snazzie is an easy to use static site generator that uses the powers of Gulp to allow for live development reloading, asset compilation and minification as well as deployment to github pages. Its pure front end goodness designed by a front end developer, for front end developers.

## That's AWESOME! How Do I get started with Snazzie?

More to come soon. Currently working on making this an NPM package for quick installation.
