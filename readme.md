# littlepioneer-gulp:  [Little Pioneer Cider House](http://littlepioneer.com/)

## What is this?

Little Pioneer Cider House is a side project that I have been working on since 2015.  It is a github page site for a friend who produces music and an absolute pleasure to work on.

The first incarnation of this site has been hand optimized.  Every image is preprocessed through tiny PNG, every page is compressed by hand, the style sheets minified by hand, the github-pages branch rebased off of master frequently, etc, etc.  (You can check it out [here](https://github.com/ninjaofawesome/littlepioneer-v2).)

As it wasn't regularly updated, it was semi-maintainable, but clearly not an ideal situation.  Thus, littlepioneer-gulp does all the heavy lifting through gulp tasks, and even deploys to github for me!

## Is there documentation on how this site was set up?

Yes!  [Check this out](https://github.com/ninjaofawesome/snazzie).
